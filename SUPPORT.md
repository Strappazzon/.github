# Support Resources

Do not use the issue tracker as a support forum. For any questions that are not specific to the project itself, seek support in the following ways:

- Search for answers and ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions).  
- Use a search engine.
- As a last resort, you may open an issue <!-- [open an issue](https://github.com/Strappazzon/<REPOSITORY>/issues/new/choose) --> on GitHub to ask for help. However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem.

## Support Policy

Support is limited to the resources listed above.
